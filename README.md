# pylops notebooks
This repository is a collection of notebooks used as part of the development of pylops library (https://github.com/equinor/pylops) as well as in official publications or courses. Both .ipynb files and .html files are uploaded, with the latter showing both code and results - download the files and open them in your local browser.

It is not meant be used as an *end product*, neither we guarantee that all notebooks will be back-compatibles with future version of the library. For official examples, refer to the user to https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html.
