This repository is a collection of notebooks used as part of the development of pylops library (https://github.com/equinor/pylops) as well as in official publications or courses. Both .ipynb files and .html files are uploaded, with the latter showing both code and results - download the files and open them in your local browser.

It is not meant be used as an *end product*, neither we guarantee that all notebooks will be back-compatibles with future version of the library. For official examples, refer to the user to https://pylops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html.

## Run the notebooks locally
To ensure that all notebooks work as expected, create a Conda environment using the ``environment.yml`` file or install the same dependencies with your favourity package distribution engine. Alternatively you can also use the ``requirements.txt`` file if you do not use Conda.  

## Run the notebooks on Binder
To open and run notebooks interactively in an executable environment, we suggest using Binder or Colab. Just click either the Binder or Colab buttons at the top of this README.
